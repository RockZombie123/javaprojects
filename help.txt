Welcome to the terminal search browser!

This browser was coded entirely with python by Saish Shankar.

I am always looking for people to optimize and add new features to my browser!

FEATURES:

Simple! Just type in a search keyword(s) to see the result!

This browser doesn't get out multiple results to confuse you, and instead gets out the most helpful one!

YOU can join a community and become a moderator!

Moderators can: optimize the code and add new search results to the browser.

Or, if you just want to become a member, you can:

Request for new features in updates
Request for upgrade (mod)

Regular users can:

Request for new features in updates
Request for new results in updates


Since this browser currently is NOT flexible,
here are all he keyword(s) you can use for searching.

help - Gives out the brwser help (as shown above).

Python - Gives out some useful info about python. (programming language)

Joe Biden - Gives out useful info about Joe Biden the president.

Konami Code - Gives useful info about the Konami Code.
